This tests an input that is all zero bytes.

One interesting property of this is that there are no natural split
points for rrs1, and in general for a given hash function there will
either be no natural split points, or all points will be natural split
points.

In the case where there are no natural split points, each chunk except
the last one will be of size `maxSize`, and in the case where all points
are natural split points, each chunk but the last will be of size
`minSize`.
