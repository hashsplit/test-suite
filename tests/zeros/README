This tests an input that is all zero bytes.

One interesting property of this is that there are no natural split
points for rrs1, and for cp32 every index is a natural split point. In
general for any given hash function one of these should be the case.

In the case where there are no natural split points, each chunk except
the last one will be of size `maxSize`, and in the case where all points
are natural split points, each chunk but the last will be of size
`minSize`.
